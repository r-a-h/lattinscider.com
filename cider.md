# Country Cider

0. ``It tastes just like eating an apple, except you don't have to chew.''

Our family likes things that work right every time.
Since 1976, we've been perfecting our cider making process!
We store apples purchased directly from the same high quality growers every year
at a *perfect* 32 degree temperature so they are always crisp.
Up to *75 tons of apples* are used on a busy day and only about 17 tons on a slow day.
To ensure delicious and consistent cider flavor, we mix several varieties in just the right combination.
Each batch is tested the old-fashioned way; taste it.

We sort, cut, and wash the apples hand.
Yes, it's time-consuming but it eliminates any chance of impurities in the cider.
The apples are ground and pressed into cider which is flash pasteurized and bottled immediately.
No additives, preservatives or sweeteners-- Just great apple flavor.
