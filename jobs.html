<p>As you can imagine, there is a lot of work involved in running a farm!
We care for animals, work in gardens, and produce cider.
We also have a bakery, a store, a playground with a maze, and a tour service.
Our farm is open nearly every day attracting locals who stop in for fresh produce, busloads of school children, and visitors from all over the world.
We need a wide variety of help!</p>
