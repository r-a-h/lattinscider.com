# Lattin's Farm

Come see for yourself.

You can see and feed baby animals.
Every spring brings new arrivals.
The animals at Lattinâ€™s are part of the family, too!
You can see chickens, roosters, bunnies, and so much more.
You can purchase a bag of food at the store and literally have them eating out of your hands.
There is nothing quite like the squeal of joy both kids and adults get by feeding the baby animals here at our farm.

Bring your children for a day at the farm.
It's an experience that will last a lifetime!
