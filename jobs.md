# Lattin's Job Opportunities 👩‍🌾

As you can imagine, there is a lot of work involved in running a farm!
We care for animals, work in gardens, and produce cider.
We also have a bakery, a store, a playground with a maze, and a tour service.
Our farm is open nearly every day attracting locals who stop in for fresh produce, busloads of school children, and visitors from all over the world.
We need a wide variety of help!

## How to Apply

If you see work you would enjoy doing, we have a form at our store you can fill out.
Also, you can drop off or mail your letter of interest.
Tell us a little about yourself, your related work experience, the days & hours you are available, and your general salary requirements.
Include a resume if you'd like.
All of these positions require a light heart, a willing spirit, and the eligibility to work in the US.
