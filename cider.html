<h1 id="Country%20Cider">Country Cider</h1>

<ol start="0">
<li> &#8220;It tastes just like eating an apple, except you don&#8217;t have to chew.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<p>Our family likes things that work right every time.
Since 1976, we&#8217;ve been perfectingÂ our cider making process!
It starts with apples purchased directly from the same high quality growers every year.
We store them at a PERFECT 32 degree temperature so they are always crisp.</p>

<p>How about 17 to 25 TONS of apples a day in our slow time and up to 75 tons a day in our busier times?
To ensure consistent cider flavor, we mix several varieties in just the right combination to produce over 4000 gallons of the best cider every week.
All the sorting, cutting, and washing is done by hand.
Yes, it&#8217;s time-consuming but it eliminates any chance of impurities in the cider.</p>

<p>The apples are ground and pressed into cider, pasteurized, and bottled immediately.
No additives, preservatives or sweeteners&#8211; Just great apple flavor.
We test each batch the old-fashioned way; we taste it.</p>
